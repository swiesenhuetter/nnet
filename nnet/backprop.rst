Backpropagation is an algorithm used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights and biases of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output. The backpropagation algorithm can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the weights and biases of the neural network randomly.
2. Feed the input data through the network to get the predicted output.
3. Calculate the error between the predicted output and the true output.
4. Propagate the error back through the network using the chain rule to calculate the gradient of the error with respect to each weight and bias in the network.
5. Update the weights and biases of the network using gradient descent.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the error is minimized or a predefined number of epochs is reached.

Here is the math for the backpropagation algorithm in more detail:

1. Initialize the weights and biases of the neural network randomly. Let the weights be denoted as W and the biases be denoted as b.

2. Feed the input data through the network to get the predicted output. Let the input data be denoted as X and the predicted output be denoted as Y_pred. The prediction can be calculated using the following equation:

Y_pred = f(W * X + b)

where f is the activation function of the network.

3. Calculate the error between the predicted output and the true output. Let the true output be denoted as Y. The error can be calculated using the following equation:

error = Y - Y_pred

4. Propagate the error back through the network using the chain rule to calculate the gradient of the error with respect to each weight and bias in the network. Let the loss function be denoted as L. The gradient of the loss with respect to the weights and biases can be calculated using the following equations:

dL/dW = dL/dY_pred * dY_pred/dW
dL/db = dL/dY_pred * dY_pred/db

where dL/dY_pred is the derivative of the loss function with respect to the predicted output and dY_pred/dW and dY_pred/db are the derivatives of the predicted output with respect to the weights and biases, respectively.

5. Update the weights and biases of the network using gradient descent. The weights and biases can be updated using the following equations:

W = W - learning_rate * dL/dW
b = b - learning_rate * dL/db

where learning_rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size of the gradient descent.

6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the error is minimized or a predefined number of epochs is reached.
